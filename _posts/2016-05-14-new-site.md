After some years with no personal website. I felt like having a website again. My former sites has always been created with my favoite technology at the time. This time it's different. I needed a site, but didn't want to throw a lot of time into it, since I've have plenty of other things to do at the moment. So I looked around the interwebs and found Jekyll in combination with Github pages.

#### What is Jekyll

Jekyll let's you transform plain text into static websites. It's pretty straight forward to use, but you need to do a little bash magic.

~~~
$ gem install jekyll bundler
~ $ jekyll new my-site
~ $ cd my-site
~/my-site $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
~~~

Jekyll supports templates and themes, so you can do pretty much anything you like. I think it's a perfect option for personal websites and blogs. Since you don't need to setup a database and do a lot of configuration. With a little luck you can be up and running in a hour or so.

You can find a lot of great themes at [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org) and read more about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)


### Hosting on Github pages

When using Jekyll you get free hosting on Github pages. Github pages is infact powered by Jekyll, so it's a nobrainer to go there for hosting. You can use your own domain if you don't link the "username".github.io
