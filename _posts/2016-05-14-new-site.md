Today I stumbled upon a site made with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. I thought
that would also be suitable for my own website, and since my website hasn't been up
in years I found some time to play around with it.

It hasn't been as easy as I hoped for, because of some technical issues with macOS,
Ruby and Jekyll. But now we're live.
