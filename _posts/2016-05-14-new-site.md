Today I managed to spend some time working on my website. I'ts been years since
it was last online. So I thought why not give it some time and love.


Today I stumbled upon a side made with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. I thought
that would also be suitable for my own website, and since my website hasn't been up
in years I found some time to play around with it.

It hasn't been as easy as I hoped for, because some technical issues with osx,
ruby and jekyll. But now we're live.
