Lately I've been working a lot on my mac, and found that I could use a little read up on Bash.
I searched for a "Getting started" guide and found a guy who made his own handbook.
He wrote the book to himself not to forget the basics of Bash.

I've not read the whole book yet but I've read enough to learn that it's worth a share. So here goes!  

The handbook can be installed with npm

~~~
npm install -g bash-handbook
~~~

You can also find it on [Github](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook)
