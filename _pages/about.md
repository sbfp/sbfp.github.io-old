## About me

Hi my name is Søren Flø Larsen. I'm a developer, solution architect and tech geek.

Currently I work at [Bankdata](http://bankdata.dk/en), a large financial company delivering IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.

I live in Kolding, Denmark with my wife Anja and our two French Bulldogs.


As a **developer** I mainly write my code in Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm kind of obsessed with writing Clean Code and I'm constantly working on writing smarter code and tests. 

As a **solution architect** I enjoy searching for, and finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems. I love spending time with the business, understanding their requirements and translating those requirements into good architecture.

As a **tech geek** I use a lot of my spare time playing around with new technologies. I think it's important to play around with other technologies and languages to keep getting better at what I do. I'ts not everything I'm able to take a deep dive into, but I think I learn a lot just by being curious

## Wanna talk?

If you have an idea or a project that you would like to have me involved in, feel free to contact me. I'm always up to brainstorming ideas and do also have some sparetime to spend ;)
