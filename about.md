Hi my name is Søren Flø Larsen. I'm a programmer, solution architect and tech geek.

Currently I work at [Bankdata](http://bankdata.dk/en), a large financial company delivering IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.

I live in Kolding, Denmark with my wife and our two French Bulldogs.


As a **programmer** I mainly write my code in Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also do COBOL but I prefer the Object-Oriented languages. I'm obsessed with writing Clean Code and I'm constantly working on writing smarter code and tests.

As a **solution architect** I enjoy searching for, and finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems. I love spending time with the business, understanding their requirements and translating those requirements into good architecture.

As a **tech geek** I use a lot of my spare time playing around with new technologies. I recently have been playing with:

* Swift

I think it's important to play around with other technologies and languages to keep getting better at what I do. I'ts not everything I'm able to take a deep dive into, but I think I learn a lot just by being curious


**_Books I recently read:_**

* [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com)
* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683)
