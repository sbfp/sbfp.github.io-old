Hi my name is Søren Flø Larsen. I'm a programmer, solution architect and tech geek.

Currently I work at [Bankdata](http://bankdata.dk/en), a large financial company delivering IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.

I live in Kolding, Denmark with my wife and our two French Bulldogs.


As a **programmer** I mainly write in Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. But I also do COBOL (Yes, I’m one of the dinosaurs).

As a **solution architect** I enjoy searching for, and finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems.

As a **tech geek** I use a lot of my spare time playing around with new technologies. I recently have been playing with:

* Swift

**_Books I recently read:_**

* [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com)
* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683)
