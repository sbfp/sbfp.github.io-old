I’m Søren Flø Larsen, a programmer, solution architect and tech geek.

As a **programmer** I mainly write in Java, but I also do COBOL (Yes, I’m one of the dinosaurs), HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Currently I work at Bankdata, a large financial company severing IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.


As a solution architect I care for finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems.
