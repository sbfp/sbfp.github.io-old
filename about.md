Hi my name is Søren Flø Larsen. I'm a programmer, solution architect and tech geek.

Currently I work at Bankdata, a large financial company severing IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.

As a **programmer** I mainly write in Java, but I also do COBOL (Yes, I’m one of the dinosaurs), HTML, CSS and Javascript.

As a **solution architect** I care for finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems.

As a **tech geek** I use a lot of my spare time playing around with new techologies. I recently have been playing around with:

* Swift (iOS Development)
* NodeJS
