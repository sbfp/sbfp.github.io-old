Hi my name is Søren Flø Larsen. I'm a programmer, solution architect and tech geek.

Currently I work at [Bankdata](http://bankdata.dk/en), a large financial company severing IT and solutions to 11 banks in Denmark.

As a **programmer** I mainly write in Java, but I also do COBOL (Yes, I’m one of the dinosaurs), HTML, CSS and Javascript.

As a **solution architect** I care for finding the right technical solutions when facing new problems.

As a **tech geek** I use a lot of my spare time playing around with new techologies. I recently have been playing with:

* Swift (iOS Development)
* NodeJS

**_Books i recently read:_**

* [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com)
* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683)
